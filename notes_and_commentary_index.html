				<h3>Participate in the Hour of Code™ at the Kentucky Science Center</h3>
				<h5>The “Hour of Code™” is a nationwide initiative by <a href="http://csedweek.org">Computer Science Education Week</a> and <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> to introduce millions of students to one hour of computer science and computer programming.</h5>

				<h4>While some of these are more TinyKid friendly than others, they're all accessible to older folks as well. So don't be shy -- dive on it!</h4>

							iFrame border/size fits the contents .... so to have smaller border of the frame, shrink up the text/image sizes
							KSC WEB PAGE NAV BAR: 40px square logo; font-size is 14px

							SPAN for individual title formatting???





							Kodable ... no counting or reading needed - just simple arrows; can copy number to continue at home
									CAN'T BE FRAMED ... SAMEORIGIN FAILURE!!!!!!

							Foos ... no reading necessary, but not *as* obvious; great starter track
							"foos.html"




							Tynker ... walks-through reading; reading needed for blocks.
									NEED TO RIGHT-CLICK TO GET PROPER LINK
									DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO WORK IN INTERNET EXPLORER
									CHECK MONITOR FIT ... DOES IT NEED SCROLLING???


							Run Marco ... reading on blocks, but if you start at holiday level it's HARD. No hints!!! EASY MULTI-LINGUAL, ON OPENING SCREEN
									CHECK MONITOR FIT ... GOT FUSSY ABOUT ZOOM



									ADD IN TYNKER'S CODE MONSTERS OR OTHER "INTERMEDIATE"???




							Monster Coding ... lots of reading and puzzling; BUT has a storyline AND real coding vocabulary, etc (explaining arrays, etc)
									SIZING HERE ALSO




							Lightbot ... other languages; arrows, but complex way of doing subprograms


									BLOCKLY IS ALSO MULTILINGUAL

							Blockly Turtle ... drawing, angles; BUT different than other "puzzles"


							Blockly Maze ... same idea as other puzzles, BUT shows Javascript




							Made with Code and Code.org ... too many rabbit-holes to wander through.
